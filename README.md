# Geometric-Transformations-of-Image

## Project
This is a simple project that demonstrates basic image processing techniques utilized in images which is applicable to a variety of applications including image registration, computer vision, medical imaging, remote sensing, and robotics. 

## Project Structure

- **Translation** ‚Äì Move the image along the x and y axes  
- **Rotation** ‚Äì Spin the image around its center  
- **Scaling** ‚Äì Resize the image larger or smaller  
- **Shearing** ‚Äì Skew the image shape diagonally  
- **Affine Transformation** ‚Äì Warp the image using point mapping
